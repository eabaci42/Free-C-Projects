Tic-Tac-Toe Game Manual
=======================

Welcome to the Two-Player Console Tic-Tac-Toe game! This manual will guide you through the rules and gameplay.

Game Overview:
--------------
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple, yet fun game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is played by two players who take turns marking the spaces in a grid with their respective symbols, 'X' and 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

How to Play:
------------
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 uses the 'X' symbol, and Player 2 uses the 'O' symbol.
3. Players take turns to choose a square to place their symbol. The squares are numbered 1 to 9, as shown below:

   1 | 2 | 3
  ---+---+---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---+---+---
   7 | 8 | 9

4. On your turn, enter the number of the square where you want to place your symbol.
5. The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
6. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 symbols in a row, the game is a draw.

Game Controls:
---------------
- The game is played using the keyboard.
- Enter the number of the square you want to mark and press Enter.
- Invalid inputs (like already marked squares, non-existent square numbers) will prompt you to enter the square number again.

Ending the Game:
-----------------
The game ends when one player wins by getting three symbols in a row, or when all squares are filled, resulting in a draw.

Have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
